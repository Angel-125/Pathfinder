description = Sometimes you just need a small pack to carry a handful of items, and the Outback fits the bill. This handy Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP) offers a convenient space to store your stuff along with some extra EVA propellant for a longer ride. Use "X" to detach from the ship's hull, and "H" to attach it again.
