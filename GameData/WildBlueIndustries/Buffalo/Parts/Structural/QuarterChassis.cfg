	description = This sturdy chassis is one-quarter the size of a standard chassis. Why such a small chassis section exists is rather puzzling. Perhaps it works best with really small rovers. It contains an integrated solar panel and a battery pack, though field upgrades can enable it to hold a variety of different resources.
