Buffalo MSEV - Explore Space In Style

The NASA Multimission Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) Is a radical new concept that uses common components for ground rovers and in-space exploration craft. This modularity opens up the possibility of a variety of different configurations. The Buffalo Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MSEV) is the KSP equivalent from Wild Blue Industries. With the Buffalo, you can explore space in style!

Features
- Modular design lets you build rovers, aircraft, and spacecraft.
- Fits inside the standard 3.75m cargo bay.
- KIS/KAS friendly; you can assemble and disassemble the Buffalo out in the field.
- Crew spaces have IVAs with support for stock as well as ASET Props/ASET Avionics.
- Designs inspired by real-world NASA MMSEV with family resemblance to ground vehicles around KSC.

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the contents of the mod's GameData directory into your GameData folder. Specifically you'll need:

CommunityResourcePack
WildBlueIndustries/000WildBlueTools
WildBlueIndustries/Buffalo
ModuleManager.dll (the latest version is included)

If these directories already exist, then delete the existing ones before installing the latest update.

---REVISION HISTORY---

- Fixed issues with CompressedAir RCS thrusters that resulted from the latest CRP update.
- Play mode support added.
- Added support for Classic Stock play mode.
- CRP is now a separate download.
- Updated to KSP 1.3.1.

2.2.5
- BARIS is now an optional download as originally intended- just took awhile for me to figure out how to make that work. DO NOT DELETE the 000ABARISBridgeDoNotDelete FOLDER! That plugin is the bridge between this mod and BARIS.

2.2 BARIS: Building A Rocket Isn't Simple
This update introduces BARIS, a replacement for the stock heat mechanic used on the mod's drills and converters. You can think of BARIS (the name is a nod to Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space) as a highly customizable Dangit-lite. Don't want your drills or converters to break? Don't want the hassle of parts wearing out? Do you prefer not to send Equipment up to repair your parts, or to requrire specific skills to repair them? No problem! All that and more are options. As always, It's Your Game, Your Choice.

BARIS IS OFF BY DEFAULT! You'll have to opt-in via the Settings->Difficulty->BARIS tab.

With BARIS, converters and drills now have wear and tear, which is indicated by the part's Quality rating. They're unlikely to break during their normal design life, but they can start to break down after you exceed their design life. If you perform maintenance on them, you can reduce the chance that they'll break. A broken drill or base part won't function, which can be either annoying or life threatening depending upon the mods you have installed. Once you fix the part, it will continue to function, but its design life will be reduced- unless you disable that option.

2.0 Buffalo Wings

The Buffalo Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MSEV) is designed for a wide variety of environments. While previous releases focused upon rover and spacecraft components, this release introduces Buffalo's aircraft components; now you can fly the Buffalo to various destinations!

New Parts

- WB-22 "Typhoon" Tiltrotor: This tiltrotor is designed for both horizontal and vertical flight. You can control the tilt angle via the new VTOL Manager GUI; just look for the helicopter icon in the app toolbar. For compact storage, the tiltrotor's blades can be folded. It is powered by ElectricCharge and takes in Atmosphere (found on Kerbin, Laythe, Eve, Duna, and others).

- WB-44 "Hurricane" Tiltrotor: This is a larger, heavy-lift version of the WB-22.

- Compressed Air RCS Thruster: Instead of running on Monopropellant, this RCS thruster runs on Compressed Air (produced by the WB-22 and WB-44).

- GTG-125 Gas Turbine Generator: Similar to a jet engine, the gas turbine generator is throttle-controlled and consumes LiquidFuel/IntakeAir. But instead of generating thrust, it generates large amounts of ElectricCharge.

- GTG-250: This is a larger version of the GTG-125.

- Buffalo Half-Service Bay: As its name sounds, this part is half the length of the Buffalo Service Bay. It can hold a single Buckboard 1000.

- Buffalo Wing Root: Specially designed for the Buffalo rover, the Wing Root gives you a place to attach wings, and it can store resources.

- Buffalo Wing: This wing fits the new tiltrotor. There are 4 types.

- Type 1 Buffalo Elevon: This elevon fits the Type 4 Buffalo Wing.

- Buffalo Winglet: This winglet is rougly equivalent to the stock AV-R8 Winglet, but done in pork-alike fashion.

- Buffalo Canard: A half-sized version of the winglet.

- Chassis 3u: 3x the size of the Chassis 1u, with 3x the storage capacity.

- S.A.F.E.R. : The Safe Affordable Fission Engine with Radiators generates ElectricCharge for your spacecraft needs. It is based upon the real-world SAFE - 400 reactor created by NASA.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Moved the Flatbeds to the Payload tab.
- Moved the Flex Fuel Power Pack to the Electrical tab.
- The Flex Fuel Power Pack is now available after unlocking the Electrics node. The available flex fuel generators increases as you unlock more tech nodes.
- Both the Tundra 200 and Tundra 400 storage tanks now have rooftop solar arrays.
- The Grizzly and Bear Cub wheels now have the ability to decouple and self-destruct.
- Moved the Bear Cub to the Miniaturization tech node.

New Part
- SCP Adapter: Use this to adapt standard crew ports (like the Mineshaft) to 1.25m parts. Thanks for the suggestion, JustJim!

WheelJack
- The top node of the WheelJack now serves as a docking port. Simply bolt the WheelJack to the ground and attach a stock Clamp-O-Tron Jr to the top (in KIS, cycle through the nodes until you select the "top" node). Then, attach a chassis or other part to the docking port, and continue your rover assembly. When finished, do a quicksave and reload, and finally, decouple the Clamp-O-Tron Jr. Thanks for the investigations, Sudragon!

Bug Fixes
- Updated Buffalo ASET cockpit to use ASET 1.4: https://spacedock.info/mod/1204/ASET%20Props

1.0.0
Buffalo has finally hit its 1.0 release! :) The parts introduced in this release complete the rover side of the Buffalo MSEV. There is still more work to do, but Buffalo is in good shape now. :)

New Parts
- Added the Buffalo Airlock Modle (BAM). It has a rooftop solar panel and it holds a single kerbal.
- Added the Buffalo Ground Stabilizer. This part has fold-out stabilizer legs to lift the rover off the ground. The Ground Stabilizer has SAS and serves as a docking port as well, letting you leave components on the ground. For this to work successfully, build the body components first, and then add the chassis. Hint: the animation slider lets you adjust the height of the ground stabilizer.
- Added the Buffalo RCS Module. This quarter-length part has SAS, RCS, some MonoPropellant, a probe core oriented for vertical flight and jump jets. It also has a small chassis spacer that you can add/remove before flight.
- Added the Mk2 5-way RCS Thruster. It has a built-in monopropellant engine.
- Added the Buffalo Passenger Cabin. It comes in two sizes: short (1u) and long (2u). Both sizes have rooftop solar panels and ladders.
- Added the Buffalo Service Bay. This 2u part has room for your various small parts and holds a small amount of ElectricCharge. You can toggle the central equipment rack as well. And it has enough space to carry a pair of Buckboard 1000 containers.
- Added the Buffalo Cargo Ramp. It fits onto the back of the MSEV and provides a handy ramp to get into the Service Bay.
- Added the Buffalo Aero Cone. There are several types to choose from.
- Added Wide versions of the Solar Flatbed.
- Redesigned the Mineshaft and moved it to the Buffalo mod. It can serve as a docking port and as a KAS port.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Redesigned the Crew Cab slightly; the ladders are now at the ends of the circular crew ports. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: You can put a Mineshaft on the circular ports and still perform EVAs.
- The Crew Cab can become a geo-survey lab even with Pathfinder installed (previously it could become a lab only if Pathfinder wasn't installed).
- The Crew Cab can become a small geo-survey lab once you unlock Field Science via the stock part upgrade system.
- The Crew Cab has an experimental science experiment that lets you Take Core Sample. You can repeat this experiment many times in the same biome. HOWEVER, unlike other experiments, you must drive a minimum distance before you can run the experiment again. WANTED: a whole bunch of science results for the WBIGeoScienceExperiment (located in 000WildBlueTools/Resources/BasicExperiments.cfg) for each biome on each planet. It's a lot, but YOU benefit by contributing to the science results! :)
- Removed deprecated parts.
- Minor bug fixes.
- Cleaned up some logging issues related to missing part modules and textures when supported mods aren't installed.
- Updated the IVAs to make them look better with IVA overlay.
- JSI Transparent Pods is now fully supported.
- Increased the size of the Mk1 5-way RCS thuster and make it comparable to the stock RCS thruster.
- The short and long passenger cabs can recycle Soil into Snacks.
- The Crew Cab can (slowly) produce Snacks from Ore.
- The Command Cab and AuxEN now have integrated Kerbal Engineer support.

0.9.8
- Updated to KSP 1.2.1
- You can now radially attach the chassis parts. Thanks for the suggestion, TheReadPanda! :)

KNOWN ISSUES
- The wheels tend to slide on the ground even when the brakes are on. I'm investigating, wheels in KSP 1.2.1 are really odd.

0.9.7
- Fixed versioning conflicts
- Moved Chassis 1u, Chassis 2u, Chassis Decoupler, Command Cab, and Crew Cab to Space Exploration.

0.9.6
- WBT update

0.9.4
- Module Manager update
- Wild Blue Tools update

0.9.3

Updated to KSP 1.2. Expect additional patches as KSP is fixed and mods are updated.

Command Cab & AuxEn
- The command cab and the auxen support part upgrades to improve their SAS levels.
- Moved the AuxEn to Advanced Flight Control.

Redecorating & Converters
- For the modules that used to require Engineers, now any class that has the ConverterSkill qualifies to reconfigure modules. For modules that used to require Scientists, now any class with the ScienceSkill qualifies to reconfigure the modules. Ditto for converters.

0.8.0
- Added a Radial Engine Mount. It is particularly helpful for landing rovers onto the ground. You can stack-mount engines and fuel tanks onto the radial mount.

0.7.0
- Added standard width 1u and 2u Solar Flatbeds. If you have parts attached to them then they won't generate ElectricCharge. Thanks for the suggestion, DStaal and Bombaatu! :)

0.6.2
- Updated to latest WBT

0.6.1
- Updated to latest WBT
- Added support for USI-LS to Buffalo parts.

0.5
New Part
- Added 2U Slim Chassis.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- You can now change the configration on tanks with symmetrical parts. In the SPH/VAB it will happen automatically when you select a new configuration. After launch, you'll have the option to change symmetrical tanks.
- Fixed an issue where the Buffalo asteroid scanner would not display the results window after scanning an asteroid.
- Fixed an issue where the JetWing hover GUI would not appear.
- Fixed an issue where the JetWing would disable RCS on the entire vessel when it had no engine thrust.

Flex Fuel Power Pack
- The Flex Fuel Power Pack now uses the standard configurable storage window to select flex fuel types. You still need to go EVA to change it, and it requires an Engineer (Pathfinder users can turn off the skill requirement).
- The Flex Fuel Power Pack will have the appropriate fuel resource storage for the selected fuel type.

Resources
- All Buffalo chassis parts can now participate in Pathfinder's resource distribution.
- The Outback now uses the standard resource configuration window.

0.4.2
- Fixed an issue with the editor locking up when using the M1-A1 Mountain Goat.
- The M1-A1 can now self-destruct in addition to decoupling (both when surface attached and node attached).
- Reduced the ejection force used when the M1-A1 is decoupled.
- The Buffalo Command Cab window lighting now toggles on/off with the headlights.
- If fuel tanks are arrayed symmetrically, you'll no longer be able to reconfigure them. It's either that or let the game explode (ie nothing I can do about it except prevent players from changing symmetrical tanks).

0.4.1
- Reduced fuel consumption of the LiquidFuel & IntakeAir option for the Flex Fuel Power Pack due to its limited use environments.

0.4.0
Flex Fuel Power Pack
- Flex Fuel Power Pack can now run on LiquidFuel & IntakeAir. It produces as much ElectricCharge as LiquidFuel/Oxidizer. Thanks for the suggestion, Geschosskopf! :)
- Added exhaust effects.

Buffalo Crew Cabin
- Added a node on the top to help facilitate mounting the Flex Fuel Power Pack.

M1-A1
- you can now decouple the OmniWheel when it is surface attached as well as when node mounted.

Rendering Performance
- Improved performance and reduced memory footprint for resource distribution.
- Improved rendering performancs of the Operations Manager.

0.3.4
- Updated the resource distribution on the Wagon parts.

0.3.3
- Moved OmniWheel's tech tree node to Space Exploration.

0.3.2
- Recompiled to latest WBT

0.3.1
- Update to WBT

0.3.0

New Parts
- Added the Buffalo ISRU. It has several configurations to choose from.
- Added the Flex Fuel Power Pack. The Power Pack is a 2U Buffalo chassis unit that has solar panels and also a generator that can burn Ore, MonoPropellant, or LiquidFuel & Oxidizer. Power output varies depending upon the configuration.

0.2.16
- Updated to KSP 1.1.3

0.2.15
- Fixed an issue where the crew module was not loading properly and messing up the KIS seat inventories as a result.

0.2.14

- Updated to KSP 1.1.2

0.2.11
- Updated to KSP 1.1.1

0.2.10
- Grizzly has moved to the Advanced Motors tech node.
- Retuned the durability and default traction of the Buffalo wheels. Thanks for the testing, Geschosskopf! :)

KNOWN ISSUES
- You're unable to surface attach parts to the command cab until you change its orientation after spawning the part. Just change the orientation, and change it back to the desired orientation as a workaround.

0.2.9
CAUTION: Due to major changes to wheels in KSP 1.1, you will probably need to rebuild your rovers if upgrading from a previous save. Seems like such a small update, but there was a lot of effort to get it all to work. :)

- Recompiled for KSP 1.1
- Storage containers now use a new part module; you might need to hyperedit resources back in.
- M1A1 Mountain Goats now have an eject feature. They're particularly useful for moving Pathfinder's new Multipurpose Base Module into position before discarding the wheels. By default staging is disabled to avoid /ragequit. ;)
- Reworked the ladder animation so that they'll be angled when fully deployed. This should help kerbals get in and out of the crewed parts.

KNOWN ISSUES
- The M1-A1 is no longer able to be animated to narrow its wheelbase. This is due to the new wheel system in KSP. However, if you use the half-chassis, you can attach the Mountain Goat in such a way that your rovers can still drive out of a Mk3 cargo bay.

0.2.8
- Recompiled for KSP 1.1. Many thanks and big shout out to nil2work for helping me understand the new wheel system. :)
NOTE: The M1-A1 is no longer able to animate changing from wide to narrow wheelbase due to KSP 1.1. But it still has use for creating rovers that get in and out of the Mk3 cargo bay. To do so, take the Buffalo Half-Chassis and rotate it to become the length of a standard 1u chassis and then attach the M1-A1 to the sides. This might change in the future, we'll see. :)

0.2.7
- Added support for Connected Living Spaces. Thanks for the assist, Technologicat! :)

0.2.6

Buffalo Command Cab
- Added support for TAC-LS

Buffalo Crew Cab
- Added support for TAC-LS

0.2.5 Young Feathers

New Parts
- Added the M1A0 Bear Cub. This adorable wheel is used for small rovers.
- Added the WJ400 Jaguar, a micro-jet engine. It's a great booster engine for weighed down JetWings.
- Added a half-sized chassis. It has an integrated solar panel, but no KIS storage.
- Added a quarter-sized chassis. It too has an integrated solar panel and lacks KIS storage.
- Added the ATV Command Seat. It's just like the External Command Seat, except that it cannot be radially attached.

JetWing
- Reduced the engine ISP by half. Transcontinental flights are fun and all but you know, a wee bit OP...

Wheels
- Adjusted traction values to be more in line with stock wheels. This work is ongoing, some of the stock values don't work for these wheels. Many thanks to Taniwha for the scrips that gave me the values. :)
- Fixed a collider issue with the Grizzly. It shouldn't drag its feet now. Thanks for your help Beeks! :)
- Remove interim wheel

0.2.4 Flight by Erik Groysman
This update has some minor tweaks and bug fixes to the JetWing. It is still experimental but the flight controls are a little easier to use.

JetWing
- When you load the flight scene, the JetWing will look at what fuel you're using and set up the engine mode automatically.
- Improved the jet flame effects for liquid fuel mode.
- You can now re-bind the hover control keys. Simply right-click on the wing, click "Show GUI" to display the on-screen hover controls, and click the gear button to display the hover controls keyboard mapper.
- Moved center of thrust a little lower to make the wing a bit easier to fly.
- JetWing's art assets and config files are now in the Buffalo/Parts/JetWing folder. You can safely delete all other folders in the Buffalo/Parts folder as well as the Buffalo/Spaces folder and Buffalo/Assets folder if all you want is the JetWing.

Outback
- The Outback's art assets and part file are now self-contained in the Buffalo/Parts/Outback folder.

0.2.3 Believe it or Not
The Greatest American Hero Theme Song - Believe it or Not 

Now you can fly around any planet that has an atmosphere with a personal jet-powered wing! It works similarly to a command seat; just drop it on the ground (be careful, some terrain is explosive), right-click to board it, then rotate upright. Alternately, bolt it to the side of a craft, board, and decouple. The wing can be used on any planet with an atmosphere thanks to its monopropellant-powered jet engines. Just don't expect terrific range, unless you switch to liquid fuel and fly in an oxygenated atmosphere like Kerbin or Laythe. JetWing is inspired by JetMan Yves Rossy and the defunct KerbolQuest winged jetpack. The JetWing and its accessories work best with Kerbal Inventory System and either GoodSpeed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.

In addition to the Jetwing, this release also introduces the M1A2 Grizzly, a larger wheel than the Mountain Goat that has a wider wheelbase and better traction. This all comes at the expense of not being able to enter and exit Mk3 cargo bays, however.

Finally, the Outback is now included with the Buffalo MSEV. The Outback is a small backpack that can store a small amount of a variety of different resources. It requires Kerbal Inventory System, but it's handy for those pesky repair missions and can be attached to the JetWing.

New Parts
- Added the M1A2 Grizzly.
- Added the JetWing.
- Added the JetWing Drop Tank. Works great with Good Speed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.
- Added the JetWing Parachute. Like the Outback, it can be attached to the JetWing.
- Added the JetWing Cargo Pallet. Mount these to the wing's hardpoints and you can surface-attach small items.

JetWing Flight controls
Insert: Toggle VTOL mode
PageUp: Increase vertical speed
PageDown: Decrease vertical speed
Delete: Reset vertical speed to zero
Gear: Toggle kickstand

Outback
- Moved the Outback from Pathfinder to the Buffalo category.

0.2.2

Flatbeds
- Removed KIS part mount module; it was only applicable to a small number of parts.
- You can now surface-attach parts to the flatbeds.

Buckboards
- Anybody can now stack Buckboards.

Other
- Updated to KSP 1.0.5

0.2.1

Bug Fixes
- Added collider to broken wheel mesh on the M1A1.

0.2.0

The Buffalo gets new wheels! The stock-based RoveMax M1A1 wheels were always interim placeholders, but now the Buffalo has its real wheels. The new M1A1 Mountain Goat is inspired by the wheels found on NASA’s MMSEV but they have been brought inline with the KSP art style. The current stock-based wheel will be going away. They are deprecated in this release (existing craft won’t break but you won’t find the wheels in the catalog) and it will be removed at a later date, so be sure to retrofit or retire your rovers that have the older wheels.

New Parts
- Added the M1A1 Mountain Goat. The M1A1 can switch between a wide wheelbase for normal driving, and a narrow wheelbase to get in and out of cargo bays. And to top it off, it has sound effects if you have the Wheel Sounds mod installed. Thanks for the suggestion, Supermarine! :)

- Added the Tundra 200 and Tundra 400. These are conformal storage tanks for the Buffalo that are intended for aerospace craft. Unlike the Wagon, they do not expand, but you can attach other parts to them.

Interim Rover Wheel
- The existing stock-based rover wheel has been deprecated in favor of the new M1A1 Omni Wheel. Be sure to retrofit your rovers.

Command Cab
- Increased storage slots slightly.

0.1.5

This update has more bug fixes and some minor tweaks.

Chassis
- Increased the Chassis 2u KIS storage to 200L.
- Decreased the Chassis End Unit KIS storage to 80L.

Crew Cab
- Adjusted the default EVA airlock to the right side, just like the command cab.
- Adjusted the ladder colliders to make it easier to climb up.

Command Cab
- Adjusted the ladder colliders to make it easier to climb up.

Other
- Updated to the latest version of Community Resource Pack and Module Manager.
- Converted textures to DDS.

0.1.4
This update has a couple of bug fixes- gotta reduce that technical debt!

- The MC-3000 now has the correct amount of KIS storage when storing something other than KIS items. NOTE: You'll need to switch our your resources for this change to take effect.
- Fixed an issue with the AuxEN that prevented AntennaRange from working correctly.

0.1.3

With this update, the Buffalo also gets some new additions; some mini RCS motors (with sound effects!) and a couple of animated arms (static animations, sorry) to help with asteroid exploration. There's also a couple of bug fixes for the Wagon and Buckboards, the graphics glitch with the crew cab has been fixed. Sorry, no custom wheels- yet.

New parts
- Added the 5-Way Mini RCS Thruster. This is particularly helpful for exploration craft maneuvering around large objects like asteroids. It even has sound effects! You can change the volume or disable the sound effects by opening the Settings window. To do that, press Mod B simultaneously (Mod is the Modifier key, which defaults to Alt on Windows).

- Added the Buffalo Grappler Arm. Just like the stock Advanced Grabbing Unit, the Grappler Arm is useful for grabbing things like asteroids.

- Added the Asteroid Resource Composition Scanner (ARCS). This arm works like the stock Surface Scanning Module, but only for asteroids. However, it tells you the entire composition of an asteroid instead of just its Ore content. Simply right-click on the part and click Scan Asteroid to get its composition.

Buffalo Crew Cab & Wagon
- The integrated solar panels are now more durable. If the solar panel breaks, so has your part.

Buffalo Command Cab
- Increased the crash tolerance slightly and made it consistent with the Wagon and Crew Cab.

Chassis End Unit
- Added a storage tank with some storage capacity.

Buckboards
- Buckboards show up in the Buffalo parts category again.

Bug Fixes
- Increased the Wagon's storage slot capacity to 8x8.
- All Buckboards can now be mounted to the flatbeds.
- You can now see out of both windows in the crew cabin from either seat.

0.1.2

This release fixes a number of issues that resulted from separating the Buffalo out of Pathfinder. It also introduces two new Buckboard storage containers, and a couple of new parts for the Buffalo. Finally, the Buffalo Crew Cabin and Buffalo Command Cab have been improved.

New Parts
- Added MC-2000 Buckboard and MC-3000 Buckboard. With colliders and glowing resource decals. ;)
- Added the Auxiliary Electronic Navigator (AuxEN). In the Old West, oxen were frequently used to pull wagons. The AuxEN doesn't pull anything, but it does the driving. The probe core is the same size as a Chassis 1u, and supports RemoteTech, AntennaRange, and kOS.
- Added an adapter that tapers from the Buffalo cab form factor to a 1.25m cylinder. 

Buffalo Command cab
- Widened the headlight beams and angled them down slightly for better ground operations.
- You can now toggle the headlights separately from the cabin lights. Both cabin lights and headlights will turn on when you tap on the Lights button.

Buffalo Crew Cab
- Reworked the crew cab to include doors and ladders on its sides.
- Added a small amount of inventory space.

Bug Fixes
- The Buckboard MC-1000's decal glows again.
- Fixed file paths for several Buffalo parts so they'll show up again.
- Moved Trailer Hitch to Utility.
- Moved Chassis Decoupler to Structural.

0.1.1

Bug Fixes
