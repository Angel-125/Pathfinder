	description:NEEDS[!CommunityResourcePack] = Also called nuclear salt water, this kit stores Explodium, whether made from dissolving Blutonium in Water or scooped fresh from Eve's oceans. Asteroids might have some as well. It can power mighty and terrible rocket engines or be separated back into Water and Blutonium.

	description:NEEDS[FarFutureTechnologies] = This kit stores nuclear salt water for use in advanced rocket engines, but it can also be separated into water and nuclear fuels.
