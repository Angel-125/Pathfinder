		KerbinInSpace = Is this really the way we want to travel the stars?
		KerbinInSpace = Bill was revived successfully.  Just in time too: The O2 unit needs replacing, and he's the only one who knows how to do it.  Hmm, what's that mouse doing in the air system?
		KerbinInSpace = Jeb finds being frozen very relaxing, and appears unharmed.
        KerbinInSpace = We will have to institute procedures to make sure the frozen Kerbals are left undisturbed and their stuff is left alone.  Valentina woke to a very disturbing sight of our newest scientist.  Um, you may have to send a rescue mission to retrieve a stranded Kerbal soon...

	    KerbinInSpace = There is a sense of dissociation upon waking from a long-term freezing: You know time has passed, but it doesn't feel like it.
	    KerbinInSpace = Bone density is nominal.  Muscle loss is minimal.  All biological systems are apparently normal.  Cognitive function is unimpaired.  This really works.  We can send Kerbals on years-long trips without them using supplies or getting bored.  Yes Jeb, you can get up now.

	    KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ok, so we spacewalked out to a freezer with a glass door on the side of the ship, in the middle of space, got someone in it, froze them, left them there, thawed them out, and then spacewalked them back in.  And this is supposed to be the easier way to travel around the solar system?
