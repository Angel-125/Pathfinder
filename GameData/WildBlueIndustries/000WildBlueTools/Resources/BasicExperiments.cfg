	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've gained some more insight on how the kerbal body is affected by microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = Results show a loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in the lower extremities.
		KerbinInSpace = Bone density appears to decrease with prolonged exposure to microgravity. Kerbals should exercise regularly to maintain their health.
		KerbinInSpace = Fluids tend to pool in the head and torso.
		KerbinInSpace = Researchers note a performance decrease in the cardiovascular system and a weakened immune system. Recommend regular exercise.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals prefer solid foods and ice cream to eating pastes from tubes.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Increased levels of cellular damage is noted further from Kerbin's magnetosphere.  Increasing radiation shielding is recommended.  As a side note, Bill now glows slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = High orbit does not appear to significantly change effects to bone and muscle density vs. low orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbals like looking at the stars.  Could we get a window?

		MunSrfLanded = Muscle mass and strength loss is mitigated by the 0.166g gravitational field on Mun's surface.  But only slightly.
		MunSrfLanded = Researchers note an unexpected increase in performance of the cardiovascular system from living on the Mun.  As a side note, jumping in low gravity is fun.
		MunSrfLanded = A strange burning smell has been traced to the dust tracked in by returning EVAs.  Bob has advised everyone to not panic - it appears to be the scent of Mun dust, and does not mean there's an actual fire.

		default = We've found some tool designs that work in microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = When turning a screwdriver in one direction, the kerbal will spin in the opposite direction. Future tools should have counter-torque systems built in.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like hammers. They're particularly useful on cantankerous electronics.
		KerbinInSpace = Hand saws are great for zombie apocolypses but aren't so effective in space. Recommend mounting the saw to a bulkhead or other massive object.
		KerbinInSpace = Powered wirecutters should have a hand crank in case extra force is needed.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like kPads. Just sayin.
		MunInSpace = Tool design does not appear to be affected by what body we orbit.  The engineers refer you to the results from Kerbin orbit.
		MinmusInSpace = In a completely unexpected finding, orbiting Minmus appears to be the same as orbiting Kerbin for designing hammers.  There have been some interesting ideas for ice cream scoops though.
		MunSrfLanded = Screwdriver designs for the Mun appear to be much easier than for microgravity.  It has to do with Bill being able to put his feet on the ground.
		MunSrfLanded = Mundust appears to be electrically charged and very fine.  Ideal for making power tools malfunction.

		KerbinInSpace = These crystals can be used for some New Age thingy.
		KerbinInSpace = With enough R&D, an industry could be created around high-quality protein crystal growth.
		KerbinInSpace = This experiment failed to create crystals. Instead we got near-perfect spheres. Maybe a future study could create ballbearings in space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Crystals in space tend to be thinner and spikier than those grown closer to the planetary surface.
		MunSrfLanded = Crystals grown on beds of Munar regolith exhibit some fascinatingly unusual grow patterns.  Further research will be needed to see if they are useful for anything.
		MunSrfLanded = Mun's low gravity means that crystals grown on it's surface are very similar to crystals grown in space.  It might be worth setting up a production facility.

		default = Ice cream makes a great snack.
		KerbinInSpace = Ice cream needs to be stirred while freezing in order for the ingredients to mix properly. Kerbals need exercise to keep their bodies fit in microgravity. Why not combine the two?
		MunInSpace = Mun mud pie, just sayin.
		MinmusInSpace = Mixing ice cream in Minmus orbit immediately suggests making a mint-flavored ice cream.
		DunaInSpace = The rusty planet has a nice redish tint to it- perfect for a strawberry flavored ice cream.
		IkeInSpace = Ike Cream, get it?
		MohoInSpace = How about adding jalapenos to ice cream for a spicy aftertaste?
		EveInSpace = What does the sample taste like? How does it make you feel? What if you exercice while eating the ice cream? Quick, answer! So much pressure...
		JoolInSpace = We couldn't think of any good names for this new batch of ice cream. We'll have to consult Garcia Kerman.
		BopInSpace = We considered mixing in the blood of a kraken into the ice cream, but that's just gross.
		PolInSpace = This experimental flavor of ice cream may cause allergic reactions.
		TyloInSpace = This batch of ice cream is particularly dense and creamy.
		LaytheInSpace = At first glance this ice cream flavor looks idyllic, but upon sampling it, it's not very tasty.
		VallInSpace = You come up with the idea of adding blueberries and blue tint to the ice cream.
		DresInSpace = This batch of ice cream has chunks of ice in it. It's a complete disaster. Hm...
		EelooInSpace = After looking at the window, you decide to add cookies and cream into the mixture.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface of Minmus is *not* repeat *not* made of ice cream.  On an unrelated note, does Jeb have that shipment of packaging equipment ready to send up yet?
		MinmusSrfLanded = Rumors that we are shipping Minmus home as ice cream are completely untrue.  It'd be to expensive.
		MunSrfLanded = Munar regolith appears to be a decent insulation material for ice cream containers, once stabilized.
		DunSrfLanded = Sitting out on the rolling red plains, eating ice cream...  It gives you time to think and reflect on the big questions in life, like 'Why am I here?', or 'What is my purpose in life?', or 'Do we have any food that isn't ice cream?', or 'Shouldn't I be wearing a helmet?'

		KerbinSrfLanded = Daytime temperatures are somewhat higher than nighttime temperatures here.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Temperatures go down if you put the thermometer underground.  Of course, the thermometer is designed to be operated in space...
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The presence of water seems to mitigate the day/night temperature shifts.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = We expected the temperature to be remain very high, but it seems the desert cools off quite a bit at night.

		KerbinInSpace = Measuring the temperature of space appears to be very hard - we are getting the temperature of our ship, not the surrounding vacuum.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperature readings appear to be largely dependent on whether the thermometer is exposed to Kerbol at the time of the reading.
		KerbinInSpace = Experimental readings were disrupted by Bill trying to bake a cake.  Where he found an oven we're not sure.  The cake was delicious though.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperatures inside the ship are largely as set by the life support system.  Wait, you wanted us to measure the *outside* temperature changes?

		MunSrfLanded = Temperature changes appear to be extreme on the Munar surface - dependent largely on the position of the sun.

		KerbinSrfLanded = The Goo remains goo.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The Goo becomes watery goo.  Or is that ooze?

		KerbinInSpace = Microgravity appears to cause some weird crystallization - the goo originally was one lump, but has broken up into thousands of tiny shards.  They appear to be damaging the interior of the container...
		KerbinInSpace = The goo appears to be liquid enough for surface tension to form it into a stable sphere.  Well, unless it gets bumped.  Then it wiggles a bit until it's a sphere again.  Um, what was that about learning about the formation of the Mun?
		KerbinInSpace = Ok, I'm bored.  The goo's a sphere, just like all the other times I checked it...  Where'd it go?

		KerbinInSpace = Glycerol test failed: Jeb drank the glycerol.  On a sidenote: Getting Jeb on a sugar high in an enclosed space is not recommended.
		KerbinInSpace = Ethylene glycol test failed: The mouse appeared to revive a moment before dying.  Symptoms indicate acute oxalic acid poisoning.

        KerbinInSpace = Cognitive function appears unimpaired.  The mouse beats Bill through the maze by a factor of 50%.
        KerbinInSpace = There was an issue with the glykerol feed during revival.  The mouse appears ok, despite that.
        KerbinInSpace = There was an unplanned thaw event.  Apparently you can't just unplug this thing.  Anyone have an idea how to get the smell of dead mouse out of a spaceship?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The more intense radiation of deeper space doesn't appear to affect the DeepFreeze process.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The combination of the ion storm and the restricted glykerol feed has had an unanticipated affect on the mouse: It's skin has taken on an unhealthy pinkish tone, along with extreme growth in most of the body, with the exception of the cranial cavity, which has shrunk.  General health appears fine despite that, but further testing is warranted.
