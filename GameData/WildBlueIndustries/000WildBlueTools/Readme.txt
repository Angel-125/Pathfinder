 - Bug fixes

1.88.2
- Bug fixes

1.88.0
- Removed BARIS dependency dll.

1.86.0

WBIModuleResourceHarvester has new configurable parameters:

- solarOrbitRequired: if set to true, then the harvester can only work when in solar orbit.
- requiredAnomalies: set to the names of one or more PQSCity anomalies (ex: Monolith00), with multiple names separated by semicolon, the harvester will only work when in proximity to an anomaly on the list.
- minAnomalyRange: in meters, what is the minimum distance required from an anomaly that is requred in order for the harvester to work.
- ANOMALY_RESOURCE: the harvester supports the new ANOMALY_RESOURCE configuration node, which lets it harvest special resources that are associated with anomalies. The harvester does NOT need its requiredAnomalies field to be filled out in order to harvest this special resource. If the harvester is in range of the anomaly, then it will harvest the resource. See below for an example.

NOTE: These changes also apply to WBIGoldStrikeDrill.

WBIOmniConverter has new configurable parameters.

- solarOrbitRequired: if set to true, then the harvester can only work when in solar orbit.
- requiredAnomalies: set to the names of one or more PQSCity anomalies (ex: Monolith00), with multiple names separated by semicolon, the harvester will only work when in proximity to an anomaly on the list.
- minAnomalyRange: in meters, what is the minimum distance required from an anomaly that is requred in order for the harvester to work.

Sample ANOMALY_RESOURCE config
You can find this in 000WildBlueTools/Templates/AnomalyResources.

// You can specify one or more resources that are associated with an anomaly (a static game object marked as an anomaly, like a monolith).
// WBIModuleResourceHarvester will mine the resources if in close proximity to the anomaly.
// You do NOT need to set requiredAnomalies on WBIModuleResourceHarvester.
ANOMALY_RESOURCE
{
	// Name of the anomaly
	name = Monolith00

	// Name of the resource that the anomaly has.
	resourceName = Graviolium

	// Optional. Minimum abundance of the anomaly's resource. The actual abundance depends upon this value and maxAbundance.
	// If specified, then the anomaly has an unlimited amount of the resournce.
	minAbundance = 0.001

	// Optional. The maximum abundance of the anomaly's resource. The actual value is between minAbundance and maxAbundance.
	// If specified, then the anomaly has an unlimited amount of the resournce.
	maxAbundance = 0.1

	// Optional. The minimum amount of resource that the anomaly has. The actual amount depends upon this value and maxAmount.
	// If specified, then the anomaly has a limited supply of the resource. Once exhausted the resource will no longer be harvested unless the node contains minAbundance/maxAbundance.	
	minAmount = 1000

	// Optional. The maximum amount of resource that the anomaly has. The actual amount is between minAmount and maxAmount.
	// If specified, then the anomaly has a limited supply of the resource. Once exhausted the resource will no longer be harvested unless the node contains minAbundance/maxAbundance.	
	maxAmount = 5000
}

1.81.1
- Updated OmniConverter part info.

1.80
- WBIOmniStorage now supports its own set of MAX_RESOURCE_MULTIPLIER nodes. If defined within the part module, and a global MAX_RESOURCE_MULTIPLIER has the same resource, then the part module's MAX_RESOURCE_MULTIPLIER definition will be used instead.

1.79
- WBIOmniStorage now supports its own set of OMNIRESOURCECOMBO nodes. If a combo is defined within the part module and a combo with the same resources is defined as a global OMNIRESOURCECOMBO, then the part's OMNIRESOURCECOMBO will be used.

1.78
- Bug fixes

1.77
OmniConverter Templates
- Templates can now specify a minimumCrew as a requirement to run. The part must have a crew equal to or greater than the specified minimum in order to run. If the template also specifies an ExperienceEffect then each minimum crew member needs the ExperienceEffect.
- Templates can now list requiresCommNet as a requirement to run.
- Templates can now list one of: requiresSplashed, requiresSubmerged, or requiresOrbiting as requirements to run.
- Templates can now produce Science as a YIELD_RESOURCE if in career or science sandbox mode.

New OmniConverter templates
- Lab Time - produces LabTime. It requires that the part have a minimum crew of 2.
- Science! - produces Science as a yield resource. It requires that the part has a minimum crew of 2 and requires a CommNet connection back to the home world.

- Misc. Bug fixes
- Moved Pathfinder's GoldStrike to Wild Blue Tools.
- You can now prospect at any time, but some resources won't be found unless you travel a certain minimum distance (hint: 3km is typical).
- Sample GOLDSTRIKE config node:
GOLDSTRIKE
{
	resourceName = Aurum

	//Restricts where the resource can be found. Separate multiple types by semicolon. Options: Planetary;Oceanic;Atmospheric;Exospheric. Planetary is default.
	resourceTypes = Planetary

	//List of planet names, separated by semicolon, where the resource can be found. Default: Any, which means any planet can have the resource.
	planetsFound = Any

	//List of biome names, separated by semicolon, where the resource can be found. Default: Any, which means any biome can have the resource.
	biomesFound = Any

	//The minimum distance in kilometers between prospect attempts required in order to include the resource among the possible prospected resources.
	//Default is 3 kilometers.
	//Ex: Aurum, Gemstones, and PreciousMetals all require you to travel at least 3 kilometers before they become available. Assume that Blutonium could be found every 5km.
	//If you only travel 2km before making a prospect attempt, then none of the resources will be found. If you travel 6km, then Aurum, Gemstones, PreciousMetals, and Blutonium
	//will all be potential candidates for prospecting. You still need to make a successful prospecting check to obtain a node.
	minProspectDistance = 3

	//Minimum required altitude in order for the resource to be a prospecting candidate. Can be negative for below sea level. Default is a double.MinValue.
	//minAltitude = 0

	//Maxiumum required altitude in order for the resource to be a prospecting candidate. Can be negative for below sea level. Default is double.MaxValue.
	//maxAltitude = -1000

	//If near an anomaly, some resources are more likely to occur than others. This parameter indicates how likely the resource will be found near an anomaly.
	//anomalyChance = 65

	//Minimum units in the lode
	minAmount = 200

	//Maximum units in the lode
	maxAmount = 4000

	//Roll well enough, and multiply the lode size by this multiplier
	motherlodeMultiplier = 1.5
}

1.60
Last release for KSP 1.4.5!

WBIOmniStorage
- You can now specify a maxAmountMultiplier on individual resources within an OMNIRESOURCECOMBO. Just add the field to a RESOURCE node. It defaults to 1.0. This field will take the final amount of units that a part can hold for the given combo resource and multiply it by maxAmountMultiplier.
- You now have the ability to decouple resources within a resource combo and adjust their amounts individually.

WBIOmniConverter
- Converters can now produce one or more resources that are specified by a YIELD_RESOURCE node after a set amount of time has passed. Check out the Greenhouse converter template in Templates/ClassicStock/OmniConverters.cfg for an example.
- Converters have the option to require a die roll to determine if the resource yield succeeds, fails, critically succeeds, or critically fails. This only applies to resources defined by YIELD_RESOURCE nodes. To enable, set minimumSuccess, criticalSuccess, and criticalFailure to values greater than 0 on an OMNICONVERTER template.
- Converters can now support background processing (They run even when the vessel is unloaded). USE SPARINGLY! Too much background processing will slow the game down. For performance reasons, converters are run in the background once every six in-game hours. To enable, set enableBackgroundProcessing = true in an OMNICONVERTER template node.
- Converters now support effects. You can specify a startEffect, stopEffect, and runningEffect.

PROTIP: If you don't specify any templateNodes, then you can still set up an OmniConverter to work like a regular ModuleResourceConverter, but with the extra benefits of playing Effects, timed resource production with optional success checks, and background processing (yes, you can set it at the part module's config node if you don't use omni converter templates).

Classic Stock
- Added new Greenhouse OmniCoverter template. It's only available if Snacks is installed. It will produce Snacks after 180 hours. There's a chance that the yield will be higher than normal, lower than normal, or fail completely. It also runs in the background.
- The Haber Process, Composter, Snack Grinder, and Organic Chips Omni Converters will now convert their resources even when the vessel is unloaded and out of physics range.

Bug fixes
- Fixed issue where switching Play Modes would cause some files to not be renamed and cause all kinds of fun for players...

1.59
WBIOmniStorage
- Added new MAX_AMOUNT_MODIFIER node that can be used to increase the storage capacity of a particular resource. See the new OmniStorageModifiers.cfg file located in Templates/Common for details.

Classic Stock
- Fixed issue with OmniConverters incorrectly displaying "missing" status after changing the recipie.
- OmniConverters will now properly prepare their conversion recipie after you change what they convert.

- Added new Breakthrough Research contract. It makes use of the WBIUnlockTechResult module described above.
- New WBIModuleAsteroidResource allows you to guarantee that a resource will be available if the asteroid is a magic boulder.
- New WBIToolTipManager can read PART_TIP config nodes and provide tips to players. It's an alternate way to teach players how to use specific parts and handy for those who don't read the KSPedia, part descriptions, or wiki pages.
- Many updates for Classic Stock play mode - thanks JadeOfMarr! :)

Refinery

The Refinery is an new app available at the space center and in flight. It lets you produce and/or store resources in limited amounts. Such resources could be rare and not readily available for purchase. In fact, if you try to launch a craft with Refinery resources, those resources will be cleared before pre-launch. Once you launch the craft, you can purchase the Refinery resource, and when you recover the craft, its Refinery resources will be stored in the Refinery up to its maximum capacity.

Refinery nodes specify resources that are produced and/or stored in the Refinery.
You can specify one or more Refinery nodes with the same resource. Each node will become a production tier and appear in the order that you list them in the config file. Below is an example.

//New tiers appear in the same order as these nodes appear in the config file.
REFINERY
{
	resourceName = Graviolium

	//Optional tech node required to unlock the tier.
	techRequired = wbiSaucerTechnologies

	//How many units per day of the resource to produce
	//Set to 0 if you want to just store the resource and not produce it.
	unitsPerDay = 10

	//Multiplied by the resource's unit cost to determine the cost to produce a unit of the resource.
	unitCostMultiplier = 1.75

	//Maximum number of units that can be stored at the Refinery.
	maxAmount = 50000

	//The cost to unlock the production tier
	unlockCost = 250000
}

1.40

ARP Icons
Added new Alternate Resource Panel icons courtesy of JadeOfMaar. These look great! :)

Bug Fixes And Enhancements
- Fixed missing resource requirements when templates require multiple resources.
- Inflatable parts can now be inflated only once.
- Added new WBICruiseControl part module. WBICruiseControl must be placed after your engine part module and multimode switch modules. It enables you to conduct engine burns during timewarp. NOTE: Heat mechanics don't work during cruise control, this is a known limitation. To use cruise control, be sure to set the desired throttle in the context menu, and set the fuel reserve percentage. Finally turn on Cruise Control. Then engage timewarp. Note that KSP doesn't allow you to adjust the controls in the context menu during timewarp, that's a game limitation.

- Greenhouses now show where they're at in the growth cycle and show up in the Ops Manager.

1.6.0
- Experiments can now be created in the field by some labs. To that end, experiments have the option to specify what resources they need and how much. If not specified, then a default value will be used that's equal to the experiment mass times 10 in the default resource, or a minimum amount of the default resource, whichever is greater.
- Labs have the ability to restrict the experiments they create based upon a list of tags. Hence experiments may list a set of tags as well. If an experiment has no tags that match the tags required by the lab then it won't show up in the list of experiments that it can create.

1.3.1
- Added Local Operations Manager window to enable controlling all PartModules on all vessels within physics range that implement IOpsView. This is used by mods such as Pathfinder.
- Added Slag and Konkrete resources, templates, and icons.
- Added WBIProspector and WBIAsteroidProcessor. These PartModules can convert non-ElectricCharge resources into all the resources available in a biome/asteroid, and can produce a byproduct resource. A typical use is to convert Ore/Rock into the locally available resources and Slag.
- The Rockhound template now uses the new WBIAsteroidProcessor to convert Ore and/ore Rock.

1.3.0
- Updated to KSP 1.1.3
- Introduced IOpsView to enable command and control of parts from the Operations Manager.
- Refactored the WBIMultiConverter to use a template selector similar to the WBIConvertibleStorage.
- WBIConvertibleStorage/WBIMulticonverter will show you all the templates that a part can use, but templates that you haven't researched yet will be grayed out.

1.2.9
- Removed Dirt from the USI LifeSupport template.
- Added icons for USI-LS templates.
- Added the WBIModuleDecoupler part module that can switch between a decoupler and a separator.

1.2.8
- Fixed an issue where converter text and experiment manifest text wasn't showing up in the VAB/SPH.
- Fixed an issue where you'd see crew portraits in a nearby vessel even though you're focused upon a different vessel.
- Fixed an issue where a science experiment would be run when transferring the experiment out of a lab, even though it hasn't met all the requirements.
- Fixed an issue where a science lab could not transmit data back to KSC when RemoteTech is installed. NOTE: This is a pretty simplistic fix; future updates will account for packet transmission rates etc.

1.2.7
- Fixed issues with USI-LS.

1.2.6
- Added new props

1.2.5
- Improved GUI for selecting resources
- You can now click on the laptop prop's monitor to change the image.

1.2.4
- More Input is NULL error fixes.

1.2.3
- More Input is NULL error fixes.

1.2.2
- Fixed NREs and Input Is NULL errors.

1.2.1
- Minor bug fixes

1.2.0

Science System
- Added a new science system that lets you load experiments into the Coach containers, fly them to your stations and transfer them into a MOLE lab, and once completed, load them back into a Coach for transport back to Kerbin. The experiments have little to no transmit value, encouraging you to bring them home (or if you prefer, load them into an MPL). The new experiments can have many requirements such as orbiting specific planets at specific altitudes, various resources, minimum crew, and required parts. To give players an added challenge, you can optionally specify the percentage chance that an experiment will succeed. You even have the ability to run a specific part module once an experiment has met the prerequisites- that gives you the ability to provide custom benefits. Consult the wiki for more details.

1.1.5
- Adjusted Ore and XenonGas capacities to reflect stock resource volumes.
