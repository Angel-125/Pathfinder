	description = Like its ground-based counterpart, the Pipeline Orbital Mass Driver can shoot Rocket-assisted Object Containers (ROCs) vast distances- but only to other orbiting mass drivers. It can also receive ROCs from other mass drivers. Launching a ROC costs guidance data to calculate the trajectory, ElectricCharge to launch the projectile, and LiquidFuel and Oxidizer for course corrections. The destinations are limited by changes to orbital altitude and orbital inclination- best results can be obtained by small differences in both altitude and inclination.
