	description = Pipeline is a combined mass driver and mass catcher. It can launch Rocket-assisted Object Containers (ROCs) hundreds of kilometers away to another Pipeline Mass Driver or to an Orbital Pipeline. The maximum payload capacity varies based factors like range to the target and the pull of gravity. Launching a ROC costs guidance data to calculate the trajectory, ElectricCharge to launch the projectile, and LiquidFuel and Oxidizer for course corrections.
