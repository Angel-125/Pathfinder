	// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
	// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
	// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
	// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
	// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
	// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
	// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
	// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
	// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

	description = The Multipurpose Base Module (MBM) serves as a foundation for your bases; just attach inflatable modules to its access ports and set the module directly onto the ground with nothing underneath. It even has attachment points for rover wheels (like the M1A1) to move the module into place, and its fuel cell and solar panels will keep the lights on until a crew arrives. The all new Conestoga Mk2 is so different from the original that only the name remains the same. You could even say that Engineers stole the name from the original.
