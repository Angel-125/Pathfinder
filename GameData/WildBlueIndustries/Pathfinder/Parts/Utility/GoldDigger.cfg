	description = Also known as the Dancing Devil, the Gold Digger digs into the crust of planets or into asteroids to obtain core samples. These samples are then analyzed to determine the accuracy of resource scans which will improve or hinder resource extraction rates for all drills in the biome. It can also serve as a mini resource drill in a pinch; when operated by a skilled scientist, you'll be able to improve its efficiency. Comes with a free case of dust wipes.
