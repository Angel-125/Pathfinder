PART
{
	// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
	// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
	// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
	// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
	// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
	// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
	// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
	// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
	// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

	description = When a construction site or favorite orbit becomes cluttered with junk and you don't have a skilled engineer around, this recycler arm can help clean up the mess. Just attach one to your vessel or rover, extend the arm, and aim the blowtorch at the junk part. The part will then be broken down into its usable resources, and any resources it stored will be recovered as well.
