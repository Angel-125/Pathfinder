	shortName = Strip Miner
	description = When an army of Gold Diggers aren't enough or the Drill-O-Matic is too unwieldy, the Claim Jumper Strip Miner lets you rip those resources right out of the ground and separate them. The Claim Jumper does use up a tremendous amount of electric charge and it generates heat, but a skilled Engineer can coax the drilling rig to operate at higher temperatures.
