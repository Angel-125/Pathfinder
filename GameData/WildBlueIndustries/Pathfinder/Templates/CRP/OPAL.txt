	description = The Oxide Processing Automated Lab (OPAL) takes the idiom of squeezing water from rocks literally. By pulling the trace amounts of hydrogen and oxygen found in things like calcium hydroxide, small amounts of water can be produced from Ore. It also produces quite a bit of Waste, which might be useful for other things.
