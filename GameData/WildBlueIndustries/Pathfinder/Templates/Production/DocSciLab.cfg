	description = More than just a fancy janitor's closet for cleaning used experiments, the Doc Commercial Science Lab, jointly developed with the Rasta Engineering Group, is designed for long-term scientific research. Just drop an experiment into the lab, start researching it, and collect the data. Be sure to periodically check back to see how much data you've accumulated. And unlike some labs, the Doc lets you publish your research to gain the respect of your peers, and sell the data on the open market in addition to transmitting the data back to KSC for science.
