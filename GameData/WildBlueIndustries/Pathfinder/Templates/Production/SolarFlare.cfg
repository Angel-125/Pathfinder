	shortName = Solar Flare
	description = An experimental fusion reactor, the Solar Flare generates a lot of power but it's finicky and is prone to breaking down.

	toolTip = The Solar Flare consumes FusionPellets, and the plant has enough supplies for a few days. If it breaks you'll lose power and have to do an EVA to effect repairs. Unlike the Hot Springs, the Solar Flare is 100% effective on all planets.
	toolTipTitle = Your First Solar Flare!
