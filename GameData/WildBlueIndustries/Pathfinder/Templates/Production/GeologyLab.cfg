	description = When you're out performing geoscience, it's nice to have a lab where you can analyze the results. That's where the Pathfinder Geology Lab comes in. With the right staff, you can make an impact in the field of astro geology. The lab specializes in soil analysis, metallurgic analysis, chemical analysis, and biome reports, all of which contribute to the knowledge of the local area.
