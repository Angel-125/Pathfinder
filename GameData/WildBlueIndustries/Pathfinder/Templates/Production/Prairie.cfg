	toolTip = If you have a green thumb, then in 90 days (or less with the right talent), you'll have crops to consume. A good crop yield will give you more edible resources than normal, while a bad yield will give you less. If the crops fail, you'll get no edible resources at all and you'll need to start over. On an unrelated note, "426 Ways To Cook A Potato" just made the top 10 reading list.
