KerbalActuators

A KSP mod that provides several part modules to manipulate various mesh transforms in a part in order to animate it. Modules include:

WBIMagnetController: Primarily used by robot arms to grab parts and move them around.
WBILightController: Controls a light.
WBIRotationController: Rotates mesh transforms to help animate a robot arm.
WBITranslationController: Moves a mesh transform back and forth.
WBIServoManager: Added after all of the above part modules in a config file, the servo manager coordinates all the controllers. It provides GUI controls to manipulate the controllers. You can create, load, and save a series of servo snapshots into a sequence and then play back the snapshots to animate a part.

WBIHoverController: Provides hover management to engines.
WBIPropSpinner: Spins props for propeller-driven engines.
WBIVTOLManager: Added after all of the above, the VTOL Manager handles hover management and can provide GUI controls for WBIRotationController.

WBIAirParkController: Enables a vessel to "part" in mid air and be treated as if landed. It's finicky but it works...

KerbalActuators comes with two sample parts: SampleArm and SampleCrane. To use these parts, you'll need to rename the config files, found in Parts/Utility from .txt to .cfg.

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the contents of the mod's GameData directory into your GameData folder.

---REVISION HISORY---

1.9.0
- Hover GUI no longer appears when disabling the UI for screenshots.
- Updated hover control keyboard bindings:
CTRL + H: Toggle Hover
Translate up: Increase vertical speed
Translate down: Decrease vertical speed
Brakes: kill vertical speed
- Fixed sensitive hover keyboard controls for vertical speed.

1.8.5
- Grouped events into PAW groups.
- Hover controls linked to axis action groups.

1.8.4
- Recompiled for KSP 1.12.2.

1.8.3
- Bug fixes

1.8.2
- WBIPropSpinner can now be controlled via throttle setting via isThrottleControlled flag. Default is false. If set to true, then when the engine is running and operational, the spinning is controlled by throttle instead of thrust. For RCS, RCS must be activated.

1.8
- Updated to KSP 1.8

1.7.4
- Fixed inability to reverse thrust on the electric fans.

1.7.1
- Fixed WBIMultiModeEngine to work with KER. Stock delta-v not supported.

1.7.0
- Recompiled for KSP 1.6
- Bug fixes.

1.6.3
- KSP 1.5 update

1.6.2
- WBIHoverController now handles hover state updates instead of WBIVTOLManager. This allows multiple craft within physics range of each other to independently hover.

1.6.0
- You can now add custom drawing controllers via reflection.

1.5.1
- Bug fixes

1.5.0
- WBIPropSpinner now supports RCS! You don't need a ModuleEnginesFX; just set enabledByRCS to true in WBIPropSpinner, and minThrottleBlur to determine when to start blurring the rotor.

1.4.8
- Bug Fixes

1.4.6
- Recompiled for KSP 1.4.4

1.4.5
- Added additional infrastructure to support 3rd party mods like MOARdV Avionics Systems.

1.4.0.0
- Added new WBIMultiModeEngine. It works like the stock MultiModeEngine except that you can switch between any number of engines instead of just two. It also is tied into the WBIHoverController.

1.3.0.5
- Minor edits to support VTOL ops.

1.3.0.4
- Minor bug fixes

1.3.0.3
- Minor fixes for reverse-thrust in WBIPropSpinner.

1.3.0.2
New Actuators
- WBITranslationController: This part module lets you move mesh transforms around.

New Sample Parts
- Mk1 Station Arm (Advanced Construction): This arm can be use to maneuver payloads around. Found in Parts/Utility/SampleArm.
- Konstruction Krane (Advanced Construction): The ground equivalent to the Mk1 Station Arm, the Konstruction krane is helpful for picking stuff up on the ground and placing them were you want to. Found in Parts/Utility/SampleCrane.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Added an emergency stop button to halt all servo movement.
- When your rotation controller is moving in one direction and you rotate in the opposite direction, the controller will now immediately stop and start rotating in the proper direction.
- Add icons for several servo control buttons.
- WBILightController now works properly.
- You can now specify where to find the icons using a KerbalActuators config node:
KerbalActuators
{
	iconsFolder = WildBlueIndustries/001KerbalActuators/Icons
	VTOLAppButtonIcon = WildBlueIndustries/001KerbalActuators/Icons/VTOLAppButton
}

1.2.0
- Added WBIMagnetController and WBILightController.
- Added XML document comments to all the modules.
