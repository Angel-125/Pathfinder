{
// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

	description = Inspired by asteroid capture bag technology that's totally not related to baloon animals, the Stockyard-series of Inflatable Orbital Construction Docks provide ample room from which to build a variety of different vessels or tear them apart. The Stockyard 375 is the big brother in the series. It is designed to fit in the 3.75-meter standard payload diameter when deflated and can accommodate vessels up to 42 meters in diameter when inflated.
