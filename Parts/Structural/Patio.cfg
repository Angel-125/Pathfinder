title = Patio Concrete Slab
manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = Made from the finest stuff not on Kerbin, the Patio is made from "Muncrete," a generic term that mixes local regolith with chemicals in the kit to form a fast-drying concrete slab. Its stored volume represents the chemical package used to create the slab. Once formed, simply radially attach it to a ground pilon or a Saddle. The Patio is designed to provide a small level surface that you can build upon, but it has connector points to clip additional slabs together to form a larger surface.  WARNING: Use at your own risk, this is an experimental part.
